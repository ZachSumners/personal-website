I recieved my undergraduate degree in Honours Astrophysics from the University of Calgary, and am now a graduate student at McGill University. Under the direction of Dr. Daryl Haggard, I am keenly interested in the cross section between astrophysics and machine learning, investigating the application of diffusion models applied to James Webb Space Telescope observations of Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way.</p> <p>I have a diverse array of computational research and extracurricular experience spanning a wide range of subject matters. This includes large-scale computational analysis of astrophysical data from state-of-the-art instruments including the James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, and Chandra X-Ray Telescope. I also have hands-on experience with ground-based optical research telescopes at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory in Calgary, Canada.</p> <p>In my time away from academia, I am an advocate for astronomy outreach and student leadership. I have participated in a variety of groups including 4H, the University of Calgary Physics and Astronomy Students Association, and was the Volunteer Coordinator at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory for three years, enabling thousands of Calgarians to access astronomy education.</p>"},{"location":"about/#extracurricular-interests","title":"Extracurricular Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Hiking and Nature</li> <li>Climbing</li> <li>Montreal Adventures</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/adventures/","title":"Montreal Adventures","text":"<p>The vibracy and amount of things to do is one of my favorite parts about Montreal!

Such a camera is set up at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (RAO). It takes a photograph once every 4 minutes (including during the day) and saves it to an archive. Over 5 years worth of images exist in the database. The camera also works in parallel with a Sky Quality Meter (SQM), a more simplistic device that simply measures the darkness of the sky straight above it. The SQM runs only at night time, and saves its readings to a database as well.</p> <p>The night sky is a very dynamic place! Clouds, satellites, airglow, humidity and many others may affect the seeing quality and darkness. For the purposes of light pollution studies, it is helpful to know what the conditions of the sky were when the SQM took its readings. However, this information is not stored. To combat this problem, I created a machine learning network to classify the weather conditions of each image stored by the all sky camera, and use the classification (clear, cloudy, partly cloudy, etc) to sort the SQM readings automatically. Each all sky camera image and SQM reading is tagged with a date and time, so it is easy to cross reference them when the sky condition has been determined! This task is trivial for a human, but there are millions of images over the years. A machine learning algorithm can classify an image in a fraction of a second!</p> <p>The figure below shows an example of how an early version of the algorithm classified such images!</p> <p></p> <p>In the end, I was successfully able to automate the determination of sky conditions above the RAO using all sky camera images, and could sort the SQM readings by weather!</p>"},{"location":"projects/variables/","title":"Automated Variable Star Analysis","text":"<p>Differential photometry is a observational astronomy technique that I use frequently. A significant challenge in analyzing astrophysical observations is the contamination of extra light from a host of other phenomena, including but not limited to clouds, atmospheric conditions, and diffusion extended objects in the line of sight. Differential photometry solves that by using nearby sources as comparison objects, essentially allowing us to subtract out any local variation due to unknown phenomena in the image. </p> <p>The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (RAO) has telescopes that specialize in wide field optical imaging, making the data prime candidates to catch variable stars or exoplanet transits. In this project, I created a Python pipeline to automate the detection of variable sources in widefield imaging with the help of differential photometry. The data I used as input was a series of images looking at the same patch of sky over equally spaced intervals.</p> <p>With careful selection of which neighbours to use for differential photometry, we see variable behaviour with some sources in our observations. The figure below is a test case where we see inject variability into a few sources, and see if the pipeline can recognize it.</p> <p></p> <p>It indeed can! The pipeline can review the variability of thousands of sources over many hours of imaging!</p>"},{"location":"reasearch/","title":"Research","text":"<p>With recent advances in telescope hardware, astrophysical data is being collected at an unprecedented rate. As such, advanced automated or semi-automated methods are required to process such observations. My interest is in this cross section between computational methods such as machine learning and astrophysics.</p> <p>Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) at the center of the Milky Way is 100 times closer than the next nearest  supermassive  black  hole.  It  has  long  been  an  object  of  observational  interest  due  to  its comparatively weak accretion, variability in the form of flaring, and relative proximity which make it a perfect laboratory to study accretion theory and test general relativity [1]. </p> <p> </p> <p>It has been observed for over two decades in  a variety of  electromagnetic regimes in the radio, sub-millimeter, near-infrared, far-infrared, and X-ray regions [2]. This has allowed the characterization of its spectral energy distribution (SED), a large-scale illustration of its flux as a function of wavelength. Such a distribution has generated classes of models to describe its emission and variability, improving our understanding of black hole growth, activate galactic nuclei, and extreme accretion physics [3, 4]. However, there still exist open questions about the underlying physics that drive its behavior and subsequent response at different wavelengths, so an accurate description of Sgr A*\u2019s light profile is important [2]. Furthermore, the density of the galactic center make observations very difficult. Take the figure below of radio observations in the galactic center as an example.</p> <p>In this project, we employ contemporary machine learning techniques that characterize and remove noise to extract precise flux information and improve our understanding of Sgr A*\u2019s light profile in the previously unmeasured mid-infrared region with the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>"},{"location":"reasearch/#relevant-publications","title":"Relevant Publications","text":"<p>[1] R.
