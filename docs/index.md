My name is Zach Sumners, I am a Master's student in the Department of Physics at McGill University studying the application of machine learning on observations of Sagittarius A*. I am passionate about the search for nontrivial relationships in large datasets, and seek to employ advanced computational methods to make predictions. 

This website seeks to showcase my research portfolio, extracurricular involvement, and outline some of my computational skills.
